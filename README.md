Files

The code takes for granted all the data is present in the same folder, un-zipped and without names altered.

CodeBook.md describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that was performed to clean up the data.

run_analysis.R contains all the code to perform the analyses described in the 5 steps.

The output of the 5th step is the file averages_data.txt, which is uploaded in the course project's form.
